## What's Included
This expansion pack includes 6 more unique pilots:

![Thorne](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/699323570211520556/1083617793313865828/thorne.png)
**Thorne** - Dawn Bringer: (Requires 2 Power) At the start of each mission, add Fire to all Vek.

> An RST maintenance drone left to tend a far-off solar power station. Extended isolation left her AI more and more unstable, warping her commitment to the station into an all-consuming devotion to the sun, believing herself its holy chosen warrior. She was eventually rediscovered during the Vek invasion, and while deemed too far gone for further maintenance work, they turned her zealous enthusiasm and rampant pyromania toward the Vek menace, for better or worse.

![Seivert](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/699323570211520556/1083617792286269500/biohazard.png)
**Dr. Seivert** - Detox: Gains 1 additional healing from all sources.

> A military medic rescued from a timeline over a year into a complete Vek takeover. Not much is known about his previous life, other than that it's a miracle he even made it to the present day. Fending off the alien wasteland has left him disfigured and possibly poisonous, and it's not clear whether the suit keeps hazards inside or out. The mechs' advanced equipment allows him to sustain himself, and his experience with counteracting the hazardous chemistry of the Vek proves invaluable on the field.

![Oynon](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/699323570211520556/1083617792667942953/oynon.png)
**Father Oynon** - Patient Defense: Gains a shield when moved 1 or fewer tiles since last turn. 

> While reluctant to glorify any of his actions against the Vek, Oynon was inspired to defend the sentient machines and his island congregation when the Vek first attacked. He was a beloved Pinnacle philosopher and religious leader, particularly fond of Old Earth sprituality involving balance and inner peace. Oynon has learned to apply these principles on the battlefield through "tactical meditation", and can perfectly counter the Vek's predictable attacks when allowed to calmly focus. Despite his cold and pessimistic demeanor, he acts as an untouchable anchor for the squad to rally around.

![Pegasus](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/699323570211520556/1083617792877666304/pegasus.png)
**Pegasus** - Nano Wires: (Requires 1 Power) Connects to aligned allies and buildings at the end of each turn, damaging Vek in between.

> A young AI grown from an Archive datacenter deep underground, Project Pegasus is still under development. It began to wake up soon after the Vek invasion began, and was awash in records of their attacks. Its compiled knowledge of the Vek is second to none. To not risk destabilizing its software during transfer, its current body is fashioned from the very server racks it formed in, and draws more cockpit power than the Mechs can sustain. It has to link up with nearby buildings and allies in combat to share, but its long-range cable connectors can snare and strangle Vek caught in between.

![Ash](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/699323570211520556/1083617793079005255/scravenger.png)
**Ash Williams** - Overdrive: Loses 1 health and gains 1 movement at the start of each turn.

> A rambunxious street racer at heart, Ash was a prodigy in the RST pilot recruiting program and a genius technician, despite nearly being thrown out several times for rebellious behavior. Ash has reworked their mechs into the souped-up supercars they used to joyride in, achieving incredible speeds on the field, only with some serious risks to their stability. Even as a proper pilot, they get into frequent disputes with the repair crews, redoing and undoing their overhauls in between missions. Young, hotheaded, and difficult to manage, Ash can run circles around their enemies.

![Delta](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/699323570211520556/1083617792487608340/glider.png)
**Delta** - Panopticon: (Requires 1 Power) Deploys a support drone for each mission. 

> An advanced and possibly alien spy craft modified to integrate with the Mechs. It maintains its connections to a fleet of other drones cloaked all over the islands, and can call them in for support, though they are not outfitted for combat. Seemingly unaligned with or against the Vek, it acts as a curious observer for some unknown master, and has tentatively agreed to defend the Grid to maintain its drone network. Delta serves as a powerful, mysterious ambassador, though its attempts at communication have yet to be decrypted...
