The folder is now a valid modpack! Just extract the zip and put it right in the game's mods folder.

Feedback is preferred on the relevant channels of the official discord (or the specialized thread if that's still available): https://discord.gg/xRxPAb87JW

Check the Issues tab for known bugs that are being worked on.

Looking for my mechs? You can find them here: https://github.com/Hederarch/ItB-Mod-Squads

This mod is a sequel! Find the first one here: https://github.com/Hederarch/ItB-Mod-Pilots

*(also these do require the Into the Breach modloader. That shouldn't be a problem for most people but download it if you don't have it.)*
